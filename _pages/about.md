As a librarian, I am deeply committed to enhancing library services by integrating technology and contributing to the library science field through my research publications on the application of data science in libraries. My aim is helped to broaden the knowledge base of the library community and provide valuable insights into the use of data-driven approaches to enhance library services.

I constantly seek new ideas and opportunities to collaborate with like-minded professionals to create better solutions for our patrons. I believe that through active engagement and knowledge sharing, we can collectively advance the field of library science and serve our communities better.

Should you have any inquiries pertaining to my research or wish to explore potential collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.
